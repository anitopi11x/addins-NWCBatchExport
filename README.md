# NWC Batch Export

The NWC Batch Export is a tool by BIM One that helps you export your 3D views in batch to a predefined folder. Instead of having to go through the classic export process for each and every view, you can simply select multiple views at once and let the plugin do the rest. 



**Benefits** 

- Time saving 
- Constant export through NWC files 
- Naming convention is dealt within Revit
